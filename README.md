# Econometric Theory: The 100-Day Challenge
You find the code and data used in my playlist on Econometric Theory. Eventually, I will publish the notes as a book in 2024/2025.

# E1: Econometric theory: Join the 100-day challenge
This video introduces the 100-day challenge. Can you master Econometric Theory in 100 days? We start exploring the linear regression model and dive into matrix algebra. Join me!
