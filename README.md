# Econometric Theory: The 100-Day Challenge
You find the code and data used in my playlist on Econometric Theory. Eventually, I will publish the notes as a book in 2024/2025.

# E1: Econometric theory: Join the 100-day challenge
This video introduces the 100-day challenge. Can you master Econometric Theory in 100 days? We start exploring the linear regression model and dive into matrix algebra. Join me!

# E2: System of linear equations in matrix form
This is our first exercise. We will write a system of linear equations in matrix form. We will get used to column vectors and matrices. Dimensions and multiplication are covered.

# E3: Strict exogeneity
This video explores the assumption of strict exogeneity, which is imposed in the context of the linear regression model.

# E4: The Law of Total Expectations
In exercises, we calculate conditional expected values and explore the Law of Total Expectations.

# E5: No Systematic Error
This video explores the implications of strict exogeneity. We show that error terms of the linear regression model cannot be regarded as systematic. They are uncorrelated with all explanatory variables. This fact follows from strict exogeneity.

# E6: The data matrix in Python: NumPy
This video introduces NumPy. We will build a data matrix in Python step-by-step. We import NumPy, and introduce arrays. We learn about indexing and assigning arrays. The attributes shape and size of arrays are explained. Finally, we dive into matrix multiplication.

# E7: An Into to Synthetic Data in Python
Obtaining actual data can be expensive, difficult, or even impossible (e.g., in the case of extreme events). In the absence of a data-generating process, synthetic data might be an option. Synthetic data has many applications in testing and machine learning. This video explores synthetic data in Python.
